## flip-to-hebrew

Someone asked me if there is a tool for mac to flip written english test to hebrew if he forgot to switch the keyboard from english to hebrew prior of writing something.

Back in the Microsoft Windows days there was a tool by the name of [הפוך על הפוך](http://www.freeware.co.il/hebrew/) but I havent been able to find a mac version of it and that person wanted the same experience on the mac, to be able and flip the gibrish text to hebrew with a shortcut.

So i've created this simple apple script for him which can be installed quickly as a service on your mac and you can also assign a shortcut key for it.

### installation instruction

Download the automator package from [here](https://github.com/israelio/flip-to-hebrew/raw/master/bin/flipToHebrew.zip)

Open the zip, double click on the automator package (flipToHebrew.workflow) and choose to install it.

In order to assign a shortcut open the keyboard settings pane and choose shortcuts, choose Services on the left menu and under Text service on the right choose flipToHebrew and assign it a shortcut of your choice.
