## flip-to-hebrew

Someone asked me if there is a tool for mac to flip written english test to hebrew if he forgot to switch the keyboard from english to hebrew prior of writing something.

Back days in windows there was a tool by the name of [הפוך על הפוך] (http://www.freeware.co.il/hebrew/) but i couldn't find a mac version of it and that person wanted the same experience on the mac, to be able and flip the gibrish text to hebrew with a shortcut

So i've created this simple apple script for him which can be installed quickly as a service on your mac and assign a shortcut key for it.

### installation instruction

Download the automator package from [here](https://github.com/israelio/flip-to-hebrew/bin/fliptohebrew.zip)
